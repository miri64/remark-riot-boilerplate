# The friendly OS for the IoT
## Martine Lenders ([m.lenders@fu-berlin.de](mailto:m.lenders@fu-berlin.de))

???

* Hello, my name is Martine Lenders.
* I'm working as a researcher for Freie Universität Berlin and
* I'm one of the main contributors to the RIOT operating system --
* the friendly operating system for the Internet of Things,
* which I like to present you today.

# Why RIOT?

???

So the first questions you might want to ask:

* Why a dedicated operating system for the Internet of Things and
* why RIOT?

# IoT today
![Propriatary IoT](figs/prop-iot.svg)

???

* Well if we look at the Internet of Things today we see that basically every
manufacturer uses there own dedicated environment
* sometimes standardized, sometimes proprietary
* and there is no way to - if you want to - let for example interact your light
  switch with your heater.

# Our vision
![Our vision of the IoT](figs/riot-iot.svg)

???

* Our vision is build around free and open source software (please ignore the
android icon here) and build upon open and well-specified protocols
* Since these led in our experience to the success story of both the Internet
  and the UNIX-oid operating systems
* So what we want is a *true* Inter*net* of Things: A network of network of
  Things which are able to communicate with each other without proprietary
  Web-services in-between

# Why a dedicated IoT OS?

![Why RIOT?](figs/why-riot-1.png)

But why not use for example Linux?

Well, you all probably know the devices Linux usually runs on, but

# Why a dedicated IoT OS?

![Why RIOT?](figs/why-riot-2.png)

???

* but if we look at the devices RIOT supports, you can see that you hardly can
  fit Linux on them (or only something that isn't really Linux anymore)

# Why a dedicated IoT OS?

![Why RIOT?](figs/why-riot-3.png)

???

* On the other hand side, those devices can definitely benefit of our software suite for IP-based
  Internet protocols I mentioned earlier
* instead of using bare-metal solutions

# Why a dedicated IoT OS?

> “If your device cannot run Linux, run RIOT!”

???

So our motto is: "If your device cannot run Linux, run RIOT!", since programming
an application for RIOT can be very similar to programming an application for
Linux.

But if you choose RIOT, what does it bring to you?

# Tooling around RIOT

![Tooling around RIOT](figs/riot-tooling.svg)

???

* Our software is under LGPL and thus free software and also
* our development processes are build around well-known and freely available
tools.
* We explicity do not require to install a full-blown Eclipse suite or our own
  dedicated IDE on your system to develop software for RIOT
* Also, we support a variety of platforms. Among those are

# Some of RIOT's features

* Real-time capable kernel architecture
* Highly configurable, modular design from ground up
* Partly POSIX-compliant API
* Fully-featured IPv6 network stack
* JavaScript support (via JerryScript interpreter)
* Support for third-party software via BSD-ports like package management

???

For those interested, here is some random technical background in text:

* we have a real-time capable kernel,
* highly configurable, modular design from ground up,
* a partially POSIX-compliant API,
* a fully-featured IPv6 network stack,
* JavaScript support, and
* support for third-party software via a BSD-ports like package management
  system
